# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-FOR-SPARSE-PCM-COMPLETION
introduce a new machine learning model for sparse pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs), combining classical PCM approaches with graph-based learning techniques. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.
